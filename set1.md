# Problem 1
Given a string A, check if all the characters it contains are unique or not (case insensitive)

Input: A string

Output: Boolean, true = all characters are unique, false = not all characters are unique

ex)
unique 'cat' ---> true
unique 'bob' ---> false

# Problem 2
Given a string A, check if it is a permutation of another string B (case insensitive)

Input: 2 strings separated by space
Check if first string is permutation of second string

Output: Boolean, true = is a permutation, false = is not a permutation

ex) 
isPermutation cat act ---> true
isPermutation bob rob ---> false

# Problem 3
Given a set of numbers, compute the average.

Input: Set of numbers, each separated by a space
Assume all the numbers are positive

Output: The average number of the set

ex)
average 1 2 3 ---> 2

How would you compute/adjust the average if a number was added/removed?
