# Problem 1
Given a string A, check if it is a permutation of another string B.

Input: 2 strings separated by space
Check if first string is permutation of second string

Output: Boolean, true = is a permutation, false = is not a permutation

ex) 
isPermutation cat act ---> true
isPermutation bob rob ---> false

Can you do this without creating your own data structure?
How much space do you really need?

# Problem 2
Given a set of numbers, compute the average.

Input: Set of numbers, each separated by a space

Output: The average number of the set

ex)
average 1 2 3 ---> 2

How would you compute/adjust the average if a number was added/removed?
