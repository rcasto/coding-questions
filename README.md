Problem sets can be completed in any programming language you want

Solutions are written using Node.js/Javascript.  If you want to add solutions in a different programming language send a pull-request

To run the solutions the only pre-requisite is that you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You can then run them as follows:
```
cd /to/solution/directory
node solution.js pass-in-args
```
